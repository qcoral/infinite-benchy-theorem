dari // alexren's attempt at making *yet another* 3D printer!

Pitch: budget enclosed belted 3D printer. Can print farm for all my YSWS needs. Also just a fun device
## Day 0: February 1st, 2025

Basically did some planning and preliminary research

Here's my unfiltered notes for the day: will probably keep this in a separate document?? idk

Links I've gathered so far:
- https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/sjnw7z/conveyor_belt_3d_printers_are_they_a_viable/

	- I want to do something like this? and then a fusion of The 100:

I want this thing to be very easy to mod & hack. Should be able to live on my desk if I want

MUST be enclosed. I'll print the parts out of ABS cause I have an X1C? Thinking of a cheaper, easier to mod V0 (albeit prints slower but that's okay)

**Time elapsed: 1h**

Didn't get too much time to work on stuff today - recovering from a concussion + got caugh up in other stuff

I did move my planning and stuff from bare sublime text to an actual obsidian thing though!! So there's that

also, remembered the nevermore exists so I'm going to try to integrate that since this thing will be printing 24/7
